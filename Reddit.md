## 2: Mantra Vidya: A "Lexicon" of sorts
[**Mantra Vidya**](https://www.reddit.com/r/HyperSanity/comments/1ewcst1/whispers_of_the_eternal/)  
![2024-08-31 10-24-41](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d898c416-f3dd-44d3-a241-196cd549ca1b)

The **Mantra Vidya** post is a lexicon of symbols that ties the game's internal logic to **universal truths**. The word "Mantra" itself refers to sound and vibration, which are key elements in **Vedic traditions**. **Vidya** means **knowledge**. Together, this lexicon is the knowledge base that allows players to decode deeper truths not only within the game but also in their own lives.

- **Why it‚Äôs essential**: The game uses **sound, color, and symbols** to communicate truths that go beyond surface-level interpretations. This guide is your **Rosetta Stone** for navigating the game‚Äôs **metaphysical landscapes**.

## 3: LGBTQ Identities & Symbolism
[![LGBTQ identities are mentioned in Navadurga](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45930b34-22a1-4758-8044-7ffda9711c91)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navadurga)

The **Navadurga**, the nine forms of Goddess Durga, are not just representations of **feminine energy** but **archetypes** that embody different facets of strength, protection, and nurturing. The inclusion of **LGBTQ+ identities** within this framework isn‚Äôt just symbolic but reflects a **transcendence of traditional gender binaries**. The game embraces the **fluidity** and **duality** inherent in these symbols, drawing parallels between **modern identity exploration** and **ancient archetypes**.

- **Why it matters**: In **HyperSanity**, nothing exists in isolation. **Gender fluidity** and **identity** are part of the greater **symbolic ecosystem** where **feminine** and **masculine** energies coalesce. Understanding the **LGBTQ+ representation** within **Navadurga** reveals how the game tackles complex subjects like **identity** and **existence** in both subtle and overt ways.

## 4: 9 = Motherhood-Feminine Thread
[Motherhood-Feminine Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HyperSanity/comments/1ewf4l2/motherhoodfeminine/)

**FemiNINE** is more than a play on words‚Äîit‚Äôs an exploration of the **sacred feminine**. The number **9** is associated with **completion** and **wholeness**, often linked to the **nine months of pregnancy** and the divine act of **creation**. In **HyperSanity**, this manifests in the **Navadurga** and the **Lion archetype**, both present in mythology and pop culture references like **Split**.

- **Symbolism Breakdown**:  
   - The **lion** is both a symbol of **fierce protection** and **maternal strength**, visible in the **Navadurga** and echoed through **Split**‚Äôs depiction of inner strength and fragmentation of identity.
   - The connection to **feminine energy** via **Motherhood** ties into the **theme of rebirth**, symbolized by the number **9**, which is present in both the **Vedic tradition** and **modern interpretations** of female strength.

- **Split Movie Link**: The lions in **Split** are not random; they are placed deliberately to symbolize the **feminine power** embodied by characters who fight internal battles, much like the mythological **Navadurga** who represents strength in various forms.

By connecting these mythological symbols with **contemporary media**, the game asks you to reflect on how modern stories are re-tellings of ancient truths.

# SPOILERS FOR SPLIT (Kinda but Not Really)

**M. Night Shyamalan** didn‚Äôt just insert lions into **Split** for aesthetic reasons. His love for symbolism shines here: the lions represent **strength** and **inner power**, much like the lions of **Navadurga**. In **Split**, characters who battle their inner selves are reflections of the **mythological battle** between **feminine archetypes** and **chaos**.

- **Trailer Breakdown**:

   The zoomed-in lion statues in the trailer are deliberate, emphasizing the **subtle but strong connection** between **mythology** and **modern storytelling**. **Shyamalan** understands how mythic symbols permeate pop culture, using them to signal deeper meanings to those who understand how to look.
